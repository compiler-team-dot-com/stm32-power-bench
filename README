To get the build started, run the fullowing where `build_gcc` is the build
directory and GCC is the toolchain:

`$ meson build_gcc --cross-file arm_cortex_m4.txt --cross-file arm_cortex_m4_gcc.txt`

or, the the following where llvm is the toolchain:

`$ meson build_llvm --cross-file arm_cortex_m4.txt --cross-file arm_cortex_m4_clang.txt`

Out-of-source builds are enforced by the build system. You can choose any
name for your build directory.

To compile, run the following inside your build directory:

`$ ninja`

Debug builds are created by default.
